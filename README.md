# Tatanka

## Description

Tatanka is an experimental cryptocurrency trading bot written in Go and uses Apache Cassandra.

### Features

- BTC-USD
- Support for Coinbase Pro (previously known as GDAX)
- Simulator for backtesting strategies against historical data
- "Paper" trading mode, operates on a simulated balance while watching the live market
- Configurable sell stops, buy stops, and (trailing) profit stops

## Disclaimer

- Tatanka is still highly under development and has yet to be fully tested.
- Tatanka is **NOT** a sure-fire profit machine. **Use it AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
- Crypto-currency is still an experiment, and therefore so is Tatanka. Meaning, both may fail at any time.
- Running a bot, and trading in general requires careful study of the risks and parameters involved. A wrong setting can cause you a major loss.
- Never leave the bot un-monitored for long periods of time. Tatanka doesn't know when to stop, so be prepared to stop it if too much loss occurs.
